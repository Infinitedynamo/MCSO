3.4 - Use of Force

Level 1 - Deputy Presence

Level 2 - Verbal Communication

Level 3 - Physical Control (Cuffing/restraining)

Level 4 - Non Lethal (Taser)

Level 5 - Defensive/ Intermediate Weapons (Nightstick)

Level 6 - Deadly Force (Guns)

Passive compliant – a person who recognizes the authority of the Deputy's presence and follows the verbal commands of the Deputy.

Passive resistor – a person who refuses to follow the verbal commands of the Deputy but does not resist attempts by Deputies to take positive physical control over them.

Active resistor – a person who does not follow verbal commands, resists attempts by the Deputy to take positive physical control over them, and does not try to inflict harm on the Deputy.

Active aggressor – a person who does not follow verbal commands, resists attempts by the Deputy to take positive physical control over them and attempts to cause harm to the Deputy or others.

All LSSD Deputies are authorized to use whichever level they feel like they need to in order to control the situation. It is HIGHLY recommended that Deputies take equal or greater than force. This is simplified by Deputies using the same force or one level higher. A situation that could result in this is a suspect carrying a knife. If you are the only Deputy on scene and the suspect is becoming more aggressive you should have your service pistol out. If there are more than one Deputy on scene you should always maintain a level higher force but there should be an Deputy present with equal force.&#x20;

  * In the event that an Deputy wishes to appeal, there are steps that will be taken in order to allow a fair trial to ensue. The appeal process can be entered only ONCE per disciplinary action received. The steps are as follows:
  *
    * The disciplined Deputy and the issuing supervisor will meet in the office of the Sheriff.
    * FIRST, the supervisor will make his accusations known. The supervisor will describe the actions that led to his decision to issue the disciplinary action.
    * THEN, the disciplined Deputy will share his side of what happened. Remember, it is the disciplined Deputy’s duty to provide SOLID proof. Witnesses are NOT considered solid proof.
    * After both parties have finished, the Commissioner, the Deputy Commissioner, the C.o.D. and the Bureau Sheriff will discuss the appropriate verdict and will decide the outcome of the situation.
    * REMEMBER, once the appeal process is initiated, NO party is allowed to discuss the appeal, the situation surrounding it, or the verdict with anyone unless they are a Sergeant or higher in the LSSD and do not have direct ties to the situation at hand.
